# Identity-Games

Hi! Welcome! I'm glad you're here. In this small corner of the internet, I've uploaded a deeply personal, hilariously messy, and intensely powerful (for me atleast) game. 
Here's how to play this game:
1. Download "Identity Games v2.0.zip"
2. Unzip it to find a singular HTML file.
3. Double-click this HTML file to open the game in your default web browser. That's all!
